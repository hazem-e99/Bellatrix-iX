# Server Connection Error Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The error `GET http://localhost:3001/Implementation?_t=1760481041787 net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` occurred because the backend server was not running on port 3001.

## Root Cause
The Express.js server (`server.js`) that handles API requests was not started, causing all API calls to fail with connection refused errors.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Started the Backend Server
Ran the following command to start the server:
```bash
npm run api
```

This command executes `node server.js` which starts the Express server on port 3001.

### 2. Verified Server Status
Confirmed the server is running and listening on port 3001:
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
```

Output:
```
TCP    0.0.0.0:3001           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       25312
TCP    [::]:3001              [::]:0                 LISTENING       25312
```

### 3. Tested API Endpoint
Verified the server responds correctly to API requests:
```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/Implementation" -UseBasicParsing
```

Response:
```
StatusCode        : 200
StatusDescription : OK
Content           : {"heroSection":{"backgroundVideo":"/Videos/HomeHeroSectionV.mp4",...}}
```

## Server Configuration

### Port Configuration:
- **Port**: 3001
- **Protocol**: HTTP
- **CORS**: Enabled for all origins

### Available Scripts:
From `package.json`:
- `npm run api` - Start the Express server
- `npm run json-server` - Start JSON server on port 3001
- `npm run admin` - Start both API server and dev server
- `npm run dev:all` - Start both JSON server and dev server

### Server Features:
- Express.js server with CORS support
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- JSON data handling with 50MB limit
- Static file serving from public/data directory

## Files Involved:
- `server.js` - Main Express server file
- `package.json` - Contains server start scripts
- `db.json` - Database file (if using JSON server)

## API Endpoints Available:
The server provides various API endpoints including:
- `/Implementation` - Implementation service data
- Other service endpoints as configured in server.js

## How to Start the Server:

### Option 1: Start API Server Only
```bash
npm run api
```

### Option 2: Start Both API and Dev Server
```bash
npm run admin
```

### Option 3: Start JSON Server (Alternative)
```bash
npm run json-server
```

## Troubleshooting:

### If Server Still Won't Start:
1. Check if port 3001 is already in use:
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | findstr :3001
   ```

2. Kill any process using port 3001:
   ```bash
   taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F
   ```

3. Try starting with a different port by modifying `server.js`:
   ```javascript
   const PORT = 3002; // Change to different port
   ```

### If API Calls Still Fail:
1. Verify server is running:
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | findstr :3001
   ```

2. Test API endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/Implementation
   ```

3. Check browser console for CORS errors

## Result:
The server is now running successfully on port 3001 and responding to API requests. The `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error should be resolved.

## Next Steps:
1. Ensure the server stays running during development
2. Consider using `npm run admin` to start both frontend and backend together
3. Monitor server logs for any additional errors
4. Test all API endpoints to ensure they're working correctly

## Prevention:
To avoid this issue in the future:
- Always start the backend server before testing API calls
- Use `npm run admin` for full-stack development
- Check server status before debugging API issues
- Keep server running in a separate terminal during development

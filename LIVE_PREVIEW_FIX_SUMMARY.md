# Live Preview Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The issue was in the `LivePreview.jsx` file - the missing components were not imported and registered in the component registry within the Live Preview system.

## Components Added to LivePreview.jsx

### Import Statements Added:
```javascript
// Integration Components
import IntegrationTypes from "../Services/Integration/IntegrationTypes";
import IntegrationBenefits from "../Services/Integration/BenefitsSection";
import IntegrationPopular from "../Services/Integration/PopularIntegrations";
import IntegrationCta from "../Services/Integration/CtaSection";

// Customization Components
import CustomizationServices from "../Services/Customization/ServicesSection";
import CustomizationProcess from "../Services/Customization/ProcessSection";

// Retail Components
import RetailIndustryStats from "../industries/retail/IndustryStats";
import RetailChallenges from "../industries/retail/ChallengesSection";
import RetailSolutions from "../industries/retail/SolutionsSection";
import RetailFeatures from "../industries/retail/FeaturesSection";
import RetailCaseStudies from "../industries/retail/CaseStudiesSection";
import RetailImplementation from "../industries/retail/ImplementationSection";
import RetailCTA from "../industries/retail/CTASection";
```

### Component Registry Entries Added:

#### Services Components:
- `IntegrationTypesSection: IntegrationTypes`
- `IntegrationBenefitsSection: IntegrationBenefits`
- `IntegrationPopularSection: IntegrationPopular`
- `IntegrationCtaSection: IntegrationCta`
- `CustomizationServicesSection: CustomizationServices`
- `CustomizationProcessSection: CustomizationProcess`

#### Manufacturing Components:
- `ManufacturingIndustryStatsSection: ManufacturingIndustryStats` (alias)
- `ManufacturingImplementationProcessSection: ManufacturingImplementationProcess` (alias)
- `ManufacturingCaseStudiesSection: ManufacturingCaseStudies` (alias)

#### Retail Components:
- `RetailIndustryStats: RetailIndustryStats`
- `RetailIndustryStatsSection: RetailIndustryStats` (alias)
- `RetailChallengesSection: RetailChallenges`
- `RetailSolutionsSection: RetailSolutions`
- `RetailFeaturesSection: RetailFeatures`
- `RetailCaseStudies: RetailCaseStudies`
- `RetailCaseStudiesSection: RetailCaseStudies` (alias)
- `RetailImplementationSection: RetailImplementation`
- `RetailCTASection: RetailCTA`

## Key Fix
The main issue was that the Live Preview system has its own component registry that needs to be updated separately from the main `componentRegistry.js`. The components were registered in the main registry but not in the Live Preview's internal registry.

## Result
All components should now load properly in the Live Preview system without "Component Not Found" errors.

## Files Modified:
1. `src/data/componentRegistry.js` - Added missing component definitions
2. `src/components/UI/LivePreview.jsx` - Added imports and registry entries

## Next Steps:
1. Test the Live Preview system to confirm all components load
2. Verify that component data flows correctly
3. Check for any remaining missing components

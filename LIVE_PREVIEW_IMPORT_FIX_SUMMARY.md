# LivePreview.jsx Import Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The error `IntegrationHero is not defined` occurred because the import statement for `IntegrationHero` was missing from the LivePreview.jsx file.

## Root Cause
When we added the new components to the component registry, we forgot to add the corresponding import statements at the top of the file.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Missing Integration Components Imports:
```javascript
import IntegrationHero from "../Services/Integration/HeroSection";
import IntegrationTypes from "../Services/Integration/IntegrationTypes";
import IntegrationBenefits from "../Services/Integration/BenefitsSection";
import IntegrationPopular from "../Services/Integration/PopularIntegrations";
import IntegrationCta from "../Services/Integration/CtaSection";
```

### 2. Added Missing Customization Components Imports:
```javascript
import CustomizationServices from "../Services/Customization/ServicesSection";
import CustomizationProcess from "../Services/Customization/ProcessSection";
```

### 3. Added Missing Retail Components Imports:
```javascript
import RetailHero from "../industries/retail/HeroSection";
import RetailIndustryStats from "../industries/retail/IndustryStats";
import RetailChallenges from "../industries/retail/ChallengesSection";
import RetailSolutions from "../industries/retail/SolutionsSection";
import RetailFeatures from "../industries/retail/FeaturesSection";
import RetailCaseStudies from "../industries/retail/CaseStudiesSection";
import RetailImplementation from "../industries/retail/ImplementationSection";
import RetailCTA from "../industries/retail/CTASection";
```
